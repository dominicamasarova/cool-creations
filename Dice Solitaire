#Program: Dice Solitaire
#As their turn begin, a player has 0 turn-points. They can either
#roll the dice or hold. When they roll there are two possible
#outcomes. Most of the time the sum of the dice is added to the
#person’s turn-points and they get another turn. But if the sum
#is 2, 7 or 12 then they Bust, they lose all turn-points,and
#their turn is over. Once they get to 50 points, they win.
